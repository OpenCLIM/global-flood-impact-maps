    Visualisation of flood impacts for different scenarios

  description: >
    This model can be appended onto the end of the flood impact assessment model, or work on its own.
    If standalone, the user can add 1,2 or 4 output files generated by the Urban_Flooding: Flood Impact Assessment model.
    Taking the 1km damages, and flooded building data, this model creates georeferenced maps of the data which can be cross compared
    for different scenarios/ rainfall events.
